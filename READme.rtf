This project took part of the SemEval2024 competition whose purpose was about Emotion Discovery and Reasoning its Flip in Conversation ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://lcs2.in/SemEval2024-EDiReF/"}}{\fldrslt https://lcs2.in/SemEval2024-EDiReF/}}). SemEval tasks explore the nature of meaning in natural languages: how to characterize meaning and how to compute it. They encompass a broad range of semantic topics from the lexical level to the discourse level, including word sense identification, semantic parsing, coreference resolution, and sentiment analysis, among others.\
\
We worked on the third sub task which was an EFR in English conversations : Given a dialogue, we aimed to identify the trigger utterance(s) for an emotion-flip in a multi-party conversation dialogue.\
\
That\'92s why we divided the work into two parts : We first developed a BERT algorithm to correctly classify which emotion was associated with a specific phrase in the conversation. Then we used the same method to detect which sentence in the utterance was considered as a flip reasoning (e.g., a trigger). \
